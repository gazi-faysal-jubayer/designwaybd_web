        <h2 class="engr-title">Engr. Rabiul Islam</h2>
        <p>The managing director of Design Way, engineer Rabiul Islam, is an innovative leader in the engineering industry. He serves as the chairman of the Savar-Dhamrai organisational area of the IDEB-Institution of Diploma Engineers Bangladesh. As well, he serves as the Ashulia Engineering Association's chair. Over 9500 buildings have been constructed under his supervision, demonstrating his indisputable influence on the growth of this industry. In 1995, he finished his engineering education. He was hired as a project engineer by Citycell & Grameenphone in 1996. In 2000, he founded Design Way, marking the beginning of his entrepreneurial career.</p>
        <p>With Allah's blessing, Design Way is performing nicely. Its renown is undoubtedly due to the diligent efforts of Engr. Rabiul and his adored spouse, Mrs. Mariam Islam, a highly skilled coordinator. The harmony with which the Design Way functions is her credit. The success can be attributed to the Design Way family. We give thanks to God for allowing Design Way to reach this level.
